# PythonSyndicateCalculator

The syndicate calculator is a tool to calculate the payoffs to the contributors of the works in a syndicate. Contributors are here called recipients, and could be authors, illustrators, etc. The works in syndicate are products, which can include for example books, cds, and posters. All members benefit from the sales of all the products of the syndicate, not just from their own ones.

The calculator reads in data from a file that specifies the products, their contributors, and the production prices per piece. The user inputs the number of sold pieces of a product and how much revenue was obtained from the work. Finally, the payoffs are written to a separate file, results.txt.
